To build AutodidactAI, we can start by designing a simplified AI system that follows an iterative loop for continuous learning and improvement. The loop will involve data collection, model training, evaluation, and adaptation based on feedback. We can draw inspiration from various methodologies like OODA loop, PDCA, Lean Thinking, and Six Sigma, but we'll aim to create a simple yet effective loop tailored to the context of AI development.

Here's a high-level overview of the AutodidactAI loop:

Data Collection: Collect data relevant to the task or problem the AI system is designed to solve. This may include text, images, audio, or other types of data.

Model Training: Train an AI model using the collected data. This step may involve preprocessing the data, selecting an appropriate model architecture, and training the model using a suitable algorithm.

Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained AI model using appropriate metrics. This step may involve using a validation or test dataset to assess the model's accuracy, precision, recall, etc.

Feedback and Adaptation: Gather feedback from users or other sources to understand how well the AI system is meeting its intended goals. Use this feedback to identify areas for improvement and adapt the model accordingly.

Iterate: Continuously iterate through the loop to refine the AI system and improve its performance over time.

To implement AutodidactAI in Python, we can start by defining a few key classes:
