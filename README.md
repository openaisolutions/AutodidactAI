# AutodidactAI

AutodidactAI is a proposed AI-driven platform that envisions facilitating coding, training, and working with AI. Although currently a theoretical project, it provides a conceptual framework for a self-learning system capable of empowering continuous learning and self-improvement.

## Prioritizing AI Alignment

At this stage, our primary focus is on addressing the AI alignment problem. As we continue to study AI design and take more AI-related courses, our understanding of the alignment issue will deepen, and our approach to it will evolve.

AI alignment is a considerable challenge, and AutodidactAI will be designed with the intention of addressing this issue first and foremost. While the potential of AI is immense, it's vital that we ensure its objectives and behaviors align with human values and goals to prevent unintended consequences.

## Current Project Status

While we're not moving this project to private, we are pausing active work on it for now. AutodidactAI currently stands as a shell of a projectâ€”a blueprint for future development.

As we continue to learn and iterate, we plan to extend some AI agents to assist with writing and coursework. However, advancements in AI technology such as the ChatGPT code interpreter plugin and others could further enhance this process, making it more efficient and effective.

Despite these promising prospects, it's important to remember the potential risks associated with AI. Even a simple recursive ability to code or learn could be misused, either by a bot or a human. As such, safety and responsible use should guide the work going forward.

## Looking Ahead

We look forward to expanding this project as the broader community makes progress on pressing issues such as AI alignment, ethics, data privacy, and safe AI evolution. We believe in the power of collective effort and are excited to contribute to the ongoing development of safe and ethical AI.
